            A blockchain is a database that is shared across a network of
computers. When a record has been added to the network it is called a
chain and is very difficult to change. The records that the network
accepted are added to a block creating a blockchain as each block is
added. It enables the connection of people on an open system with
new trust architecture.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-10 text-gray-600">
            It enables you to be your own bank through a decentralized finance
system. Facilitates trustless transactions from anywhere around the
world, without the need for any intermediary.
 Blockchain is a communication network that supports Bitcoin.
 Bitcoin is the digital asset while blockchain is the technology upon
which bitcoin is built.
 Blockchain provides a secure method of transacting in bitcoin

        History of Blockchain
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-10 text-gray-600">
            In 1991 research scientist like Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta introduced a
computationally practical solution to time stamp documents digitally in a way that
it will be difficult to tamper with or backdate. This was the original idea behind the
blockchain technology. A white paper, Published in 2008 that introduced a
Peer-to-Peer decentralized electronic cash system called bitcoin in 2008 was
posted to a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto.

            A Paradigm shift is taking place in today's market and everything is
becoming digitalized.
Blockchain technology will soon be the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
 The entire way we transact financially is changing and will be
changed forever.eg remove fees on financial transactions.
 Blockchain technology would remove physical contracts,
replace voting systems, land registries and passports and also
end the piracy of digital music, films, games, TV and other
products.In addition to that , Blockchain is cheaper because it eliminates middlemen and
hence there's no need to pay processing fees on transactions.
